          <p>
            Ada Lovelace (Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace) has often been
            called ‘the first computer programmer’ for her work on Charles
            Babbage’s early mechanical calculating machines, and is credited
            with inventing the first algorithm, and essentially conceptualising
            the modern computer – or ‘thinking machine’.
          </p>
          <p>
            She rose to prominence as the namesake of the Ada computer language,
            which was designed by the French computer scientist Jean Ichbiah at
            CII Honeywell Bull under a 1977 contract with the United States
            Department of Defense.

            Annabelle was herself a mathematician, and asked another friend, the
            Scottish polymath Mary Somerville, to tutor Ada as a mathematician.
            Annabelle felt that an education in mathematics and logic would
            counteract any tendencies Ada might have inherited toward Byron’s
            ‘insanity’ and Romantic excess.
